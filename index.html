      <p>This here is some sample text.</p>
      <p><img src="wowbam!.png" alt="happy looking guy with 'WOW! BAM' in text" style="float:left;width:100px;height:100px;">Does this get written on the next line?</p>
      <p>Yes it does but look at that nasty space.</p>
      <p>Okay, I fixed that nasty space.</p>
      <p>I wanna add some more text here but also I wanna know if this is gonna continue on to be a long line and if it ever, I guess, shift to the line below. Does that make sense? Okay I just checked and it didn't do that yet. I just need to write a little more here and then check it again.</p>
      <p>It works!</p>
